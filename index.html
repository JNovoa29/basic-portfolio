                    My past experience with coding was limited to changing colors, fonts, and cursors in the HTML of MySpace and Neopets. Little did I know what it was I was truly doing! Fast forward 7 years and I 
                    found myself taking two programming courses while pursuing my Bachelor's. Sadly, I was intimidated by it despite my interest. Several years later,
                    my interest in it was reawakened when I built my very first PC. As an avid gamer and
                    recent graduate with a disposable income, I built myself an incredibly capable gaming PC. It was here
                    that a hobby was born and my interest in coding reawakened. After some deliberation on where to start
                    and when, I finally made the plunge at the University of Irvine, School of Continuing Education. While
                    coding is far from absent of frustration, the rewarding feeling that comes with building working code
                    is worth it. I'm looking forward to the skills I will gain and improve over the course of this program and look forward to where it takes me in my career.
